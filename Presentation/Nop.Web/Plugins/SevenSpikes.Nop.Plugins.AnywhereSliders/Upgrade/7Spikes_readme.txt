Steps:
1. Backup your existing database
2. If you haven't upgraded your nopCommerce website to version 3.3 already, then follow the instructions in the "nopCommerce_readme.txt".
3. Execute "7Spikes_upgrade.sql" script over your database.
4. Copy this plugin and the "SevenSpikes.Core" plugin folders to the Plugins folder of nopCommerce.
5. Start your site. If you have made any changes to this plugin in 3.2 then you need to merge them in the new version of the plugin.

Note: If you have Nop Ajax Filters plugin installed then you need to uninstall and then install it again.
